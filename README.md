Object of the Game
To outmaneuver your opponent on a mysterious battlefield. The goal is to strategically reveal your army, capture enemy pieces, and end the game with a higher score based on your remaining forces. The game ends when one player has no legal moves available.

Game Setup
The Board: The game is played on a 4-row by 8-column grid (32 squares).

The Pieces: A full 32-piece Chinese Chess set is used, with one Soldier on each side replaced by the custom Archer piece.

Preparation: All 32 pieces are shuffled and placed randomly on each square, face-down.

How to Play
Starting the Game
At the start of the game, the human player chooses to go first or second.

The First Turn (Color Selection)
The player designated to go first begins the game by choosing any single face-down piece and flipping it face-up.

The color of this revealed piece (Red or Black) becomes that player's color for the rest of the game.

The other player is assigned the opposite color.

The first player's turn is now over. The turn immediately passes to the second player.

A Regular Turn
On your turn, you must perform one of two possible actions:

Flip: Choose any face-down piece on the board and reveal it. This ends your turn.

Move: Choose one of your already revealed pieces and move or capture with it according to its rules.

Piece Movement & Capture Rules
Pieces can only move to an empty square or to a square occupied by an opponent's revealed piece. Hidden pieces cannot be captured and block movement (except for the Cannon jump).

Special Rule: Repetition Penalty
If a player makes a move that exactly reverses their opponent's last move (e.g., Player A moves a Horse from A1 to B3, and Player B immediately moves it back from B3 to A1), the player making the repetitive move will be penalized 1 point. This encourages dynamic play.

Winning the Game
The game ends immediately when the player whose turn it is has no legal actions available. This occurs when they cannot move any of their pieces AND there are no hidden pieces left to flip.

As soon as the game ends, the scores of all pieces remaining on the board are tallied. The player with the higher score wins.
